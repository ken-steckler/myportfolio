            <p>
              I'm Ken - a software engineer interested in fullstack web
              development. I've worked with both the frontend and backend and
              enjoy creating applications with my users in mind.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm always thinking of new things to create. I'm currently working
              on a React meal prep app that will let me quickly decide what I
              want to make for the week. I also plan on building my original tip
              calculator app that lets me quickly calculate tip on my phone
              without having to use my native calculator app.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am currently pursuing a Bacherlor's of Science degree in
              Computer Science at Oregon State University to build a
              foundational knowledge in the world of software engineering so
              that I can build better apps.
            </p>
            <p>
              I always strive to become a better version of myself. I try to
              raise my own bar by stepping out of my comfort zone, since that's
              how I learn best. A fun fact about me, I'm also a licensed
              pharmacist! I also enjoy jogging and photography.
            </p>
            <p>Thank you for reading and I hope you have a wonderful day!</p>
