              I'm Ken - a software engineer interested in fullstack web
              development. I've worked with both the frontend and backend and
              enjoy creating apps.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am currently pursuing a Bacherlor's of Science degree in
              Computer Science at Oregon State University to build a
              foundational knowledge in the software development world.
            </p>
            <p>
              I always strive to become a better version of myself. I try to
              raise my own bar by stepping out of my comfort zone, since that's
              how I learn best. A fun fact about me, I'm also a licensed
              pharmacist! I also enjoy jogging and photography.
