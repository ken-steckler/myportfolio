            <p>
              I'm Ken - a software engineer interested in fullstack web
              development. I've worked both the frontend and backend and enjoy
              creating applications with my users in mind.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm always thinking of new things to create. I'm currently working
              on a meal prep idea to help my mom easily decide what she wants to
              cook for the week. I plan on utilizing React for that. I also am
              thinking of creating a quick tip calculator mobile application so
              that the waiter/waitress does not wait for me twiddle my thumbs on
              my native calculator app.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am currently pursuing a Bacherlor's of Science degree in
              Computer Science at Oregon State University to build a
              foundational knowledge in the world of software engineering so
              that I can build better apps.
            </p>
            <p>
              I always strive to become a better version of myself. I try to
              raise my own bar by stepping out of my comfort zone, since that's
              how I learn best. A fun fact about me, I'm also a licensed
              pharmacist! I also enjoy jogging and photography.
            </p>
            <p>Thank you for reading and I hope you have a wonderful day!</p>
